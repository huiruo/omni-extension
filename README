We are using webpack to build the extension as described in the repo below:

Weback builds the main background script as well as the background html
page for the extension. Webpack copy plugin is used to transform env
variables in the main background script (not any of the content scripts).
Env variables are loaded using dotenv-webpack and the checked in .env files.

Steps for new extension release:
* yarn install
* To generate a production extension in dist/ folder to save articles
against production site, run: yarn build-prod
* For development extension to use against QA site (dev.omnivore.app) run yarn build-qa
* For using extension against localhost, run yarn build


Steps for creating Safari extension:
* Follow guide here:
  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/converting_a_web_extension_for_safari
* Run: xcrun safari-web-extension-converter dist/ (on the webpack built extension dist/ folder)
* In xcode, build for 'Running', next 'Archive' and finally 'Distribute' and choose 'Copy' to share manually 
with others via file.
